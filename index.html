      <p>Web Data Project is a partnership between leading researchers in the social sciences to collect and organize relevant web activity into research-quality datasets. Access to datasets is free for all qualified research institutions and WDP provides a hosted service that ensures regular, reliable, and polite web crawling. </p>
      <p> Many researchers are now crawling web pages as a means of data collection. Many websites, on the other hand, actively prevent unauthorized crawlers in order to protect both their users' privacy and their company's competitive advantage. Rogue web scraping might serve a researcher in their current agenda, but at the cost of jeopardizing user privacy or risking their ability to gather data longitudinally. WDP seeks to provide researchers, today and tomorrow, with invaluable empirical evidence while still respecting the discretion of content owners and the privacy of content creators. </p>
      <h2> How it works </h2>
      <p>
        If you are a researcher that is interested in creating a new dataset, you only need to contribute code (using WDP libraries) for crawling and parsing the desired sites. The WDP will contact the website owners to arrange the terms of crawling to ensure long-term whitelisting. WDP crawlers obey the robots.txt instructions and crawl at the specified polite speed, reliably storing the full data in WDP databases and completing crawls on a scheduled basis, for as long as the code is maintained.  </p>
      <p>
        Exact format, anonymization, and access to the generated datasets is project-specific, subject to the agreement of the website owner.
